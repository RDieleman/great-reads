        "description": "De Test is het eerste deel van een nieuwe serie waarop de fans van De Hongerspelen en Inwijding al maanden wachten! `De Test kruipt onder je huid en laat je niet meer los. De spanning, angst en woede van Cia zijn levensecht. Toen het boek uit was, kon ik nog maar aan één ding denken: meer! Marieke (26 jaar) De jonge, ambitieuze Cia Vale is tot haar vreugde een van de uitverkorenen om deel te nemen aan De Test: een jaarlijks terugkerend evenement waarvoor alleen de allerbeste studenten uit de koloniën van het Verenigd Gemenebest geselecteerd worden. Zij die slagen voor De Test hebben de wereld aan hun voeten liggen en zullen klaargestoomd worden tot toekomstige leiders van hun land. Vol goede moed, maar met waarschuwingen van haar vader in haar achterhoofd, vertrekt Cia naar de hoofdstad, waar De Test zal plaatsvinden. Als blijkt dat de inhoud van de diverse beproevingen niet alleen geestelijk, maar ook fysiek het uiterste van de kandidaten vraagt, ontstaat er een onderlinge strijd tussen de deelnemers. Cia komt al snel tot de ontdekking dat ze op zichzelf aangewezen is, maar door haar intuïtie te volgen en intelligentie en durf te tonen komt ze steeds een testronde verder, terwijl haar medekandidaten stuk voor stuk het toneel moeten verlaten, levend of dood... Heeft Cia het in zich om ook de allerlaatste horde te nemen? Kan ze overleven in het speelveld van de vierde ronde: het verwoeste en vervuilde land dat ooit Amerika was en lukt het haar om op tijd de hoofdstad te bereiken? En kan ze de mensen die het dichtst bij haar staan wel écht vertrouwen, of is niets wat het lijkt?",

Basically this is caused by the very high scale of integration of ICs, through which packages with hundreds of pins at very small pitches of down to a fraction of a millimetre, have become available. As a consequence the trace distances between the copper tracks on a printed circuit board cmne down to the same value. Not only the required small physical dimensions of the test nails have made conventional testing unfeasible, but also the complexity to provide test signals for the many hundreds of test nails has grown out of limits. Therefore a new board test methodology had to be invented. Following the evolution in the IC test technology. Boundary-Scan testing hm; become the new approach to PCB testing. By taking precautions in the design of the IC (design for testability), testing on PCB level can be simplified 10 a great extent. This condition has been essential for the success of the introduction of Boundary-Sc,m Test (BST) at board level.",

        "description": "Does your Rails code suffer from bloat, brittleness, or inaccuracy? Cure these problems with the regular application of test-driven development. You'll use Rails 5.1, Minitest 5, and RSpec 3.6, as well as popular testing libraries such as factory_girl and Cucumber. Updates include Rails 5.1 system tests and Webpack integration. Do what the doctor ordered to make your applications feel all better. Side effects may include better code, fewer bugs, and happier developers. Your Ruby on Rails application is sick. Deadlines are looming, but every time you make the slightest change to the code, something else breaks. Nobody remembers what that tricky piece of code was supposed to do, and nobody can tell what it actually does. Plus, it has bugs. You need test-driven development: a process for improving the design, maintainability, and long-term viability of software. With both practical code examples and discussion of why testing works, this book starts with the most basic features delivered as part of core Ruby on Rails. Once you've integrated those features into your coding practice, work with popular third-party testing tools such as RSpec, Jasmine, Cucumber, and factory_girl. Test the component parts of a Rails application, including the back-end model logic and the front-end display logic. With Rails examples, use testing to enable your code to respond better to future change. Plus, see how to handle real-world testing situations. This new edition has been updated to Rails 5.1 and RSpec 3.6 and contains full coverage of new Rails features, including system tests and the Webpack-based JavaScript setup. What You Need: Ruby 2.4, Rails 5.1",

        "description": "Functional Testing in Human Performance offers clinicians the first-ever compilation of information on clinical and data-based functional testing for sport, exercise, and occupational settings. This unique text serves as a primary resource for accurate assessment of individuals' functional abilities in order to develop program prescriptions to enhance their performance. Functional Testing in Human Performance is a comprehensive learning tool for novices and an essential reference for advanced clinicians. The text defines the role of function in physical performance and how it can be appropriately tested. Especially helpful for novices, the text explains testing criteria, testing terms relevant to research, and selecting the most appropriate test and testing sequence. Common testing mistakes are also presented as well as pitfalls to avoid when testing. The text also includes case studies that illustrate a variety of situations--including testing for a client recovering from a lower-extremity injury, discussing preseason testing for a large group of athletes, and presenting the study of a client in an occupational setting. These cases include detailed statistical analysis and normative data, offering clinicians the opportunity to consider the application of functional testing and implementation strategies adaptable to their specific practice setting. After laying a foundation, the text progresses to detailed testing procedures for discrete physical parameters and specific regions of the body. Tests are organized from least to most complex, and each test is presented in a step-by-step manner outlining the purpose of the test, equipment needed, testing procedure and recommendations for performing the test, interpretation of results, and the data to suggest normative values, reliability, and validity for each test. This formatting facilitates quick reference to testing information for on-the-spot use, whether in the clinic, athletic training room, gym, or job site. Throughout the text, the functional tests are accompanied by photos for visual clarity. To enhance understanding, a companion DVD features live-action demonstrations of 40 of the most advanced tests. Icons on those test pages indicate they are modeled on the DVD. In addition, the DVD may be loaded onto a computer to offer convenient print-on-demand access to reproducible forms for recording data from selected tests. Functional Testing in Human Performance offers a unique and comprehensive reference for assessment of physical activities in sport, recreation, work, and daily living. By presenting the theory and detailing the practice, this text assists clinicians in understanding and incorporating functional testing to identify their patients' or clients' limitations and enhance their performance, rehabilitation, and daily functioning.",

It guides you through the business and organizational issues that you are confronted with on a daily basis, explaining what you need to focus on strategically, tactically, and operationally. Using a risk-based approach, the author addresses a range of questions about software product development. The book covers unit, system, and non-functional tests and includes examples on how to estimate the number of bugs expected to be found, the time required for testing, and the date when a release is ready. It weighs the cost of finding bugs against the risks of missing release dates or letting bugs appear in the final released product. It is imperative to determine if bugs do exist and then be able to metric how quickly they can be identified, the cost they incur, and how many remain in the product when it is released. With this book, test managers can effectively and accurately establish these parameters.",

        "description": "Testing of Integrated Circuits is important to ensure the production of fault-free chips. However, testing is becoming cumbersome and expensive due to the increasing complexity of these ICs. Technology development has made it possible to produce chips where a complete system, with an enormous transistor count, operating at a high clock frequency, is placed on a single die - SOC (System-on-Chip). The device size miniaturization leads to new fault types, the increasing clock frequencies enforces testing for timing faults, and the increasing transistor count results in a higher number of possible fault sites. Testing must handle all these new challenges in an efficient manner having a global system perspective. Test design is applied to make a system testable. In a modular core-based environment where blocks of reusable logic, the so called cores, are integrated to a system, test design for each core include: test method selection, test data (stimuli and responses) generation (ATPG), definition of test data storage and partitioning [off-chip as ATE (Automatic Test Equipment) and/or on-chip as BIST (Built-In Self-Test)], wrapper selection and design (IEEE std 1500), TAM (test access mechanism) design, and test scheduling minimizing a cost function whilst considering limitations and constraint. A system test design perspective that takes all the issues above into account is required in order to develop a globally optimized solution. SOC test design and its optimization is the topic of this book. It gives an introduction to testing, describes the problems related to SOC testing, discusses the modeling granularity and the implementation into EDA (electronic design automation) tools. The book is divided into three sections: i) test concepts, ii) SOC design for test, and iii) SOC test applications. The first part covers an introduction into test problems including faults, fault types, design-flow, design-for-test techniques such as scan-testing and Boundary Scan. The second part of the book discusses SOC related problems such as system modeling, test conflicts, power consumption, test access mechanism design, test scheduling and defect-oriented scheduling. Finally, the third part focuses on SOC applications, such as integrated test scheduling and TAM design, defect-oriented scheduling, and integrating test design with the core selection process.",

        "description": "In recognition of the trend toward using numerical methdos for analyzing aquifer test data, Aquifer Test Modeling delineates the application of numerical Laplace inversion analytical equations and numerical models and demonstrates the use of public domain software. Written by a leading expert with over fifty years of experience, this highly practical text provides a thorough grounding in the terms and methods employed in aquifer test modeling, while also establishing a protocol for organizing and simplifying conceptual model definition and data analysis. Using graphs, tables, and sample datasets to enhance understanding, the author delineates the five major steps involved in the aquifer test modeling process. He discusses the importance of the conceptual model definition as a framework for organizing, simplifying, and idealizing information. The chapters cover the selection of appropriate aquifer test mathematical model equations compatible with previously defined conceptual models and highlight the importance of reviewing the mathematical assumption and the adjustment of data for any departures. They also explain format selection, technique selection, well function or drawdown calculation, and calibration. The book provides five sample data sets to assist the reader in becoming familiar with WTAQ and MODFLOW aquifer test modeling input and output data file contents with confined nonleaky and unconfined aquifer conditions. It includes conceptual models consisting of abbreviated descriptions of aquifer test facilities, aquifer test data, and aquifer parameter values together with selected sample file sets. These are just a few of the features that make the book a valuable tool for estimating the supply and contamination characteristics of aquifers.",

        "description": "Is there any sexier topic in software development than software testing? That is, besides game programming, 3D graphics, audio, high-performance clustering, cool websites, et cetera? Okay, so software testing is low on the list. And that's unfortunate, because good software testing can increase your productivity, improve your designs, raise your quality, ease your maintenance burdens, and help to satisfy your customers, coworkers, and managers. Perl has a strong history of automated tests. A very early release of Perl 1.0 included a comprehensive test suite, and it's only improved from there. Learning how Perl's test tools work and how to put them together to solve all sorts of previously intractable problems can make you a better programmer in general. Besides, it's easy to use the Perl tools described to handle all sorts of testing problems that you may encounter, even in other languages. Like all titles in O'Reilly's Developer's Notebook series, this \"all lab, no lecture\" book skips the boring prose and focuses instead on a series of exercises that speak to you instead of at you. Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook will help you dive right in and: Write basic Perl tests with ease and interpret the results Apply special techniques and modules to improve your tests Bundle test suites along with projects Test databases and their data Test websites and web projects Use the \"Test Anything Protocol\" which tests projects written in languages other than Perl With today's increased workloads and short development cycles, unit tests are more vital to building robust, high-quality software than ever before. Once mastered, these lessons will help you ensure low-level code correctness, reduce software development cycle time, and ease maintenance burdens. You don't have to be a die-hard free and open source software developer who lives, breathes, and dreams Perl to use this book. You just have to want to do your job a little bit better.",

The performance of a nonlinear programming algorithm can only be ascertained by numerical experiments requiring the collection and implementation of test examples in dependence upon the desired performance criterium. This book should be considered as an assisƯ tance for a test designer since it presents an extensive collecƯ tion of nonlinear programming problems which have been used in the past to test or compare optimization programs. He will be inƯ formed about the optimal solution, about the structure of the problem in the neighbourhood of the solution, and, in addition, about the usage of the corresp, onding FORTRAN subroutines if he is interested in obtaining them -ofi a magnetic tape. Chapter I shows how the test examples are documented. In parƯ ticular, the evaluation of computable information about the soluƯ tion of a problem is outlined. It is explained how the optimal solution, the optimal Lagrange-multipliers, and the condition number of the projected Hessian of the Lagrangian are obtained. Furthermore, a classification number is defined allowing a formal description of a test problem, and the documentation scheme is described which is used in Chapter IV to present the problems.",

        "description": "Decades of software testing experience condensed into the most important lessons learned. The world's leading software testing experts lend you their wisdom and years of experience to help you avoid the most common mistakes in testing software. Each lesson is an assertion related to software testing, followed by an explanation or example that shows you the how, when, and why of the testing lesson. More than just tips, tricks, and pitfalls to avoid, Lessons Learned in Software Testing speeds you through the critical testing phase of the software development project without the extensive trial and error it normally takes to do so. The ultimate resource for software testers and developers at every level of expertise, this guidebook features: * Over 200 lessons gleaned from over 30 years of combined testing experience * Tips, tricks, and common pitfalls to avoid by simply reading the book rather than finding out the hard way * Lessons for all key topic areas, including test design, test management, testing strategies, and bug reporting * Explanations and examples of each testing trouble spot help illustrate each lesson's assertion",
